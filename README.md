## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are our core plugins:


## Generate an application

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

## Generate a library

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@exec-epp/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `npm run serve {app-Name}` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


Run `npm run serve:all` to serve all applications with development server.

Run `npm run serve:all` to serve all applications with development server.
## Code scaffolding

> Run `npm run component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Building artifacts

> Run `npm run deploy` 

## Build

Run `npm run build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.


## Running unit tests
